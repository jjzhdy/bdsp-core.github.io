  description: CAR-T cell therapy is an effective cancer therapy for multiple refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies but is associated with substantial toxicity, including Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS). We developed the Visual EEG-ICANS (VE-ICANS) grading scale, a grading scale with a physiological basis that has a strong correlation to ICANS severity. VE-ICANS shows promise as a biomarker for ICANS which could help to improve clinical care through greater accuracy in assessing ICANS severity..

- title: "Interrater Reliability of Expert Electroencephalographers Identifying Seizures and Rhythmic and Periodic Patterns in Electroencephalograms"
  image: Figure3_Cali_plus_CM.png
  description: The validity of brain monitoring using EEG requires that experts can reliably identify seizures and other potentially harmful rhythmic and periodic brain activity, collectively referred to as "ictal-interictal-injury continuum" (IIIC). Prior inter-rater reliability (IRR) studies are limited by small samples and selection bias. We recruited 30 experts with subspecialty clinical neurophysiology training from 18 institutions to classify IIIC patterns 50,697 EEG samples from 2,711 patients. From these data we obtain precise estimates of expert reliability, and propose a parsimonious theory to explain the origin of disagreements between experts. The results also establish a standard for how well an automated IIIC classifier must perform to match experts.

  description: "The human electroencephalogram (EEG) of sleep undergoes profound changes with age. These changes can be conceptualized as “brain age (BA),” which can be compared to chronological age to reflect the degree of deviation from normal aging."

  description: "When trained on the clinical dataset, the RCNN reproduces PSG diagnostic scoring for sleep staging, sleep apnea, and limb movements with accuracies of 87.6%, 88.2% and 84.7% on held-out test data, a level of performance comparable to human experts."
